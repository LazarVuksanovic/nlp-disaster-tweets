# Disaster Tweets Classification

This project aims to classify tweets into positive or negative categories based on their content.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a sentiment analysis model using natural language processing techniques.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Preprocess the tweet data to remove noise like special characters, URLs, and stopwords.

2. **Feature Vector Creation**:
   - Convert the cleaned text data into numerical feature vectors using methods like TF-IDF.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Use the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to train the sentiment analysis model.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset to measure accuracy.
